Step 5
Scan the QR code received on the IDE terminial and run it with your mobile app.

1. Wait for the GUI to display a QR code and then on your mobile device:
   * Again, this may take a while
   * **From iOS:** take picture of QR code
   * **From Android:** launch Expo app and take a picture of the QR code.
2. Wait for the DT android app to start and ask for you to connect to the server.
   * This may a while as well, but the main Expo GUI will provide a status, as will the terminal you started it on.
