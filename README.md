### Install Expo

See [https://expo.io/learn](https://expo.io/learn)

1. Expo requires NPM to be installed. Download and setup from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Use NPM to install expo:

   ```bash
   > npm install expo-cli -â€“global
   ```

3. _Create an account_ if you do not have one \(You do not have to create a project\)
4. Install the Expo client on your mobile device \(iOS or Android app stores\)

### Install Dependencies

From within the _**app**_ cloned folder install project dependencies based on the package.json file

This is shown in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdeJHI19F7A&list=PLNZnizaetELN6_2k3_iRxBhJuyavhqawE&index=4&t=5m53s)

Use the NPM install command:

```bash
   > npm install
```

This may take a while

## Run the Development Environment

Use the NPM start command:

```bash
    > npm start
```

1. Wait for the GUI to display a QR code and then on your mobile device:
   * Again, this may take a while
   * **From iOS:** take picture of QR code
   * **From Android:** launch Expo app and take a picture of the QR code.
2. Wait for the DT android app to start and ask for you to connect to the server.
   * This may a while as well, but the main Expo GUI will provide a status, as will the terminal you started it on.
